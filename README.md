In 2025, the company experienced a notable sales contraction despite improving profitability. Management needs to understand **whether the decline is driven by demand weakness, pricing and product mix dynamics, or deeper structural issues,** and **where to prioritize resources** to protect profitability while restoring sustainable growth.

### Objective
This project aims to:
- Diagnose the **primary drivers** of the 2025 sales decline across **volume, price, and mix**.
- Identify categories and sub-categories with **sustained growth and healthy margins** versus those **eroding value**
- **Evaluate the volume–profitability trade-off** to distinguish high-quality growth from value erosion
- Translate analytical insights into **clear, actionable strategic priorities** to inform portfolio focus and resource allocation decisions.

### Outcome
The analysis reveals that the 2025 decline is **demand-driven** and **highly concentrated in specific categories**, while a limited set of sub-categories continues to deliver sustainable, margin-accretive growth. **These insights support more focused investment, pricing, and portfolio decisions**.

In 2025, total sales declined by **9.4% YoY**, primarily driven by a **6.2% contraction in quantity sold**. Despite weaker demand, the business successfully preserved profitability, with **profit margin improving by 7.6% YoY**.

Monthly trends reveal **higher volatility compared to 2024**, with **eight months performing below the annual average and sharp declines in September and November.** This indicates unstable demand rather than a one-off seasonal effect.

Notably, **Average Order Value (AOV) remained consistently above the yearly average**, implying that the decline was driven by **fewer transactions**, not lower basket value. This resilience is likely influenced by **category mix shifts toward higher-value Electronics**, rather than pure pricing power.

</p>

Category performance highlights a clear divergence:
- **Electronics (+18.7%)** emerged as the only growth contributor.
- **Office Supplies (-25.4%)** and **Furniture (-15.8%)** were the primary drags on overall performance.

</p>

Although sales softened across most quarters, quarterly margins consistently remained above 27%, reinforcing that the downturn was volume-led rather than driven by pricing or cost deterioration.

The 2025 sales contraction is highly concentrated at the category level. While Office Supplies and Furniture experienced material demand contraction, Electronics remains the only category with sustained growth (+18.7%).

Monthly category trends show diverging demand dynamics:

- **Electronics** displays stronger peaks and a clear December rebound, indicating resilient demand and seasonal momentum.
- **Office Supplies** is the most volatile category, with a pronounced mid-year trough, pointing to structural demand weakness.
- **Furniture** remains broadly flat, showing limited upside and weak recovery signals.

<br>
<p align="center">

</p>

Sub-category analysis explains these outcomes:
- **Office Supplies faces broad-based volume erosion**, particularly in **Paper (-48.4%)** and **Binders (-27.6%)**.
- **Furniture performance is mixed**, with **Tables (+7.5%)** as the only notable positive contributor.
- **Electronics growth is structurally driven**, led by **Laptops (+51.1%)** and **Electronic Games (+28.5%)**.

Margins improved across all categories (+5–12% YoY). However, in Office Supplies, **margin expansion coincides with sharp volume decline, suggesting price sensitivity and mix effects** may be accelerating **demand loss** rather than **stabilizing the category**.

<h1 align="center">Profitability & Margin Analysis</h1>

This analysis evaluates growth quality by examining the relationship between YoY volume change and profit margin performance at the sub-category level.

</p>

Overall margins remained stable between 22% and 30% throughout the year, with several months in 2025 outperforming 2024, indicating improved efficiency or pricing discipline.

</p>

**At the sub-category level:**
- **Printers (+82.9% YoY profit)** and **Electronic Games (+14.7%)** show strong profit momentum.
- **Paper (-36%) and Pens (-22%)** experience sharp profit declines, consistent with structural volume erosion.

<br>

</p>

**The growth vs. margin matrix segments sub-categories into four strategic groups:**
- Accelerate: **Printers and Electronic Games** combine positive volume growth with margin expansion, representing **high-quality, scalable growth**.
- Defend: **Chairs, Pens, Markers, Paper, Bookcases, and Phones** maintain acceptable margins but face declining volumes. These require **selective defense**, not blanket investment.
- Fix Pricing: **Laptops and Tables** show strong or positive volume trends but weaker margin dynamics, indicating **pricing, discounting, or cost inefficiencies** rather than demand issues.
- Deprioritize: **Sofas** show declining margins and volumes, suggesting **limited value contribution**.

<br>
<h1 align="center">Key Insight</h1>

**The company is succesfully defending profitability but not growth. The 2025 downturn is primarily driven by demand and volume weakness, not caused by margin compression or pricing inefficiencies. Profitability is supported by margin expansion and a shift toward Electronics, but growth is highly concentrated in a few sub-categories, creating dependency risk as legacy categories continue to erode.**

**Without targeted portfolio reallocation and demand recovery strategies, margin resilience alone will be insufficient to offset continued volume decline.**

<br>
<h1 align="center">Strategic Recommendations</h1>

### 1. Accelerate — Invest to Scale High-Quality Growth
- **Products:** Printers, Electronic Games
- **Objective:** Maximize value creation by scaling segments that deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - **Prioritize capital, inventory, and marketing spend** toward these sub-categories.
  - **Protect margin integrity** by avoiding unnecessary discounting; growth is demand-led, not price-led.
  - Invest in **product innovation, feature differentiation, and targeted promotions** to reinforce competitive advantage.
  - **Strengthen supply chain reliability** to support scaling without margin dilution.
- **Rationale:** These products demonstrate quality growth, expanding volumes without sacrificing profitability making them the strongest candidates for incremental investment.


### 2. Defend — Stabilize Volume Without Sacrificing Profitability
- **Products:** Chairs, Pens, Markers, Paper, Bookcases, Phones
- **Objective:** Prevent further volume erosion while preserving profitability.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - **Diagnose root causes of volume decline** (price sensitivity, substitution, channel shift, or demand saturation).
  - **Deploy selective, targeted growth levers** (bundling, contract pricing, loyalty programs) rather than broad discounts.
  - **Maintain strict margin discipline**; accept controlled volume decline where recovery would require margin-destructive pricing.
  - **Rationalize low-velocity SKUs** to reduce operational complexity and cost-to-serve.
- **Rationale:** These segments remain profitable but face structural or competitive demand pressure. The goal is value protection, not aggressive growth.


### 3. Repair Margin — Fix Economics Before Scaling Further
- **Products:** Laptops, Tables
- **Objective:** Restore economic efficiency by addressing pricing, discounting, and cost leakage before pursuing additional growth. 
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - **Review pricing and promotional depth** to identify margin leakage.
  - **Optimize cost-to-serve** (logistics, returns, supplier terms) to support profitable growth.
  - **Pause aggressive expansion** until margin performance stabilizes.
  - **Test price elasticity** carefully to rebalance growth and profitability.
- **Rationale:** Demand exists, but current growth is value-eroding. Scaling without fixing margins risks diluting overall portfolio profitability.


### 4. Deprioritize — Minimize Exposure to Value-Destructive Segments
- **Products:** Sofas
- **Objective:** Limit capital allocation and management attention due to weak value creation.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - **Reduce inventory exposure** and discretionary marketing spend.
  - Consider **SKU rationalization**, **repositioning**, or **phased exit**.
  - Attempt turnaround only if a clearly defined, economically viable strategy exists (e.g., premium repositioning or cost restructuring).
- **Rationale:** This product generates negative value across both volume and margin dimensions and should not compete for scarce resources without a compelling recovery case.
