# Diagnosing Sales Decline for Strategic Portfolio Decisions

In 2025, the company experienced a notable sales contraction despite improving profitability. Management needs to understand whether the decline is driven by demand weakness, pricing and product mix dynamics, or deeper structural issues, and where to prioritize resources to protect profitability while restoring sustainable growth.

### Objective
This project aims to:
- Diagnose the **primary drivers** of the 2025 sales decline across **volume, price, and mix**.
- Identify categories and sub-categories with **sustained growth and healthy margins** versus those **eroding value**
- Evaluate the volume–profitability trade-off to distinguish high-quality growth from value erosion
- Translate analytical insights into **clear, actionable strategic priorities** to inform portfolio focus and resource allocation decisions.

### Outcome
The analysis reveals that the 2025 decline is demand-driven and highly concentrated in specific categories, while a limited set of sub-categories continues to deliver sustainable, margin-accretive growth. These insights support more focused investment, pricing, and portfolio decisions.

<h3 align="center">Sales Performance Overview (2024-2025)</h3>

/line chart sales & aov

In 2025, total sales declined by **9.4% YoY**, primarily driven by a **6.2% contraction in quantity sold**. Despite weaker demand, the business successfully preserved profitability, with **profit margin improving by 7.6% YoY**. Monthly trends reveal **higher volatility compared to 2024**, with **eight months performing below the annual average and sharp declines in September and November.** This indicates unstable demand rather than a one-off seasonal effect.

Notably, **Average Order Value (AOV) remained consistently above the yearly average**, implying that the decline was driven by **fewer transactions**, not lower basket value. This resilience is likely influenced by **category mix shifts toward higher-value Electronics**, rather than pure pricing power.

Category performance highlights a clear divergence:
- **Electronics (+18.7%)** emerged as the only growth contributor.
- **Office Supplies (-25.4%)** and **Furniture (-15.8%)** were the primary drags on overall performance.

/chart q1-14

Although sales softened across most quarters, quarterly margins consistently remained above 27%, reinforcing that the downturn was volume-led rather than driven by pricing or cost deterioration.

/chart sales by category

The 2025 sales contraction is highly concentrated at the category level. While Office Supplies and Furniture experienced material demand contraction, Electronics remains the only category with sustained growth (+18.7%).

/line chart sales by category/

Monthly category trends show diverging demand dynamics:

- **Electronics** displays stronger peaks and a clear **December rebound**, indicating resilient demand and seasonal momentum.
- **Office Supplies** is the most volatile category, with a pronounced **mid-year trough**, pointing to structural demand weakness.
- **Furniture** remains broadly flat, showing limited upside and weak recovery signals.

Monthly category trends show diverging demand dynamics:

Sub-category analysis explains these outcomes:

- **Electronics growth is structurally driven**, led by **Laptops (+51.1%)** and **Electronic Games (+28.5%)**.
- **Office Supplies faces broad-based volume erosion**, particularly in **Paper (-48.4%)** and **Binders (-27.6%)**.
- **Furniture performance is mixed**, with **Tables (+7.5%)** as the only notable positive contributor.

Margins improved across all categories (+5–12% YoY). However, in Office Supplies, margin expansion coincides with sharp volume decline, suggesting price sensitivity and mix effects may be accelerating demand loss rather than stabilizing the category.

<h1 align="center">Profitability & Margin Analysis</h1>
This analysis evaluates growth quality by examining the relationship between YoY volume change and profit margin performance at the sub-category level.

Overall margins remained stable between 22% and 30% throughout the year, with several months in 2025 outperforming 2024, indicating improved efficiency or pricing discipline.

**At the sub-category level:**
- **Printers (+82.9% YoY profit)** and **Electronic Games (+14.7%)** show strong profit momentum.
- **Paper (-36%) and Pens (-22%)** experience sharp profit declines, consistent with structural volume erosion.

**The growth vs. margin matrix segments sub-categories into four strategic groups:**
- Accelerate: **Printers and Electronic Games** combine positive volume growth with margin expansion, representing **high-quality, scalable growth**.
- Defend: **Chairs, Pens, Markers, Paper, Bookcases, and Phones** maintain acceptable margins but face declining volumes. These require **selective defense**, not blanket investment.
- Fix Pricing: **Laptops and Tables** show strong or positive volume trends but weaker margin dynamics, indicating **pricing, discounting, or cost inefficiencies** rather than demand issues.
- Deprioritize: **Sofas** show declining margins and volumes, suggesting **limited value contribution**.

<h1 align="center">Key Insight</h1>

**The company is currently defending profitability but not growth. The 2025 downturn is primarily demand- and volume-driven, not caused by margin compression or pricing inefficiencies. Profitability is supported by margin expansion and a shift toward Electronics, but growth is highly concentrated in a few sub-categories, creating dependency risk as legacy categories continue to erode.**

**Without targeted portfolio reallocation and demand recovery strategies, margin resilience alone will not offset continued volume decline.**
